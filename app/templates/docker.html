                    &emsp;&emsp;The traditional virtual machine we use, it has some limited, such as it requires simulating the entire machine including hardware, each virtual machine needs to have its own operating system, and every virtual machine should choose the same operating system in the same project, otherwise it would not able to link together. Once the virtual machine is started, all the resources pre-allocated to it will be occupied.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;However, the docker could run directly on the host kernel and does not need to start a full operating system, the startup speed is on the order of seconds, while virtual machines usually take minutes to start.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Docker utilizes system resources more efficiently because containers do not require the additional overhead of hardware virtualization and running a full operating system.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Docker's architecture can share a single kernel and shared application library, occupying very little memory. In the same hardware environment, the number of images run by Docker is much more than the number of virtual machines, and the utilization of the system is very high.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Developers can use Dockerfile to build images and perform integration tests, while operators can quickly deploy the image directly in the production environment, or even automate deployment.<br><br>
                    &emsp;&emsp;Migrating applications is easier because Docker ensures consistency of the execution environment. Docker can run on many platforms, whether it is a physical machine, a virtual machine, a public cloud, a private cloud, or even a laptop, and its running results are consistent. Therefore, users can easily migrate an application running on one platform to another platform without worrying about the situation that the application cannot run normally due to changes in the running environment.<br><br>

        <div class="right"><h3>&emsp; &emsp; Master and Branch are called the main version and branch version of the
            project. On GitHub,
            the first project version created is usually called the Master version. But for Git, there is no difference
            between the master and the branch in the version of the development project. Each branch is an equivalent
            relationship, and the developer adjusts the version name to distinguish it. It is generally customary to
            call
            the stable version the trunk, and the rest of the changes and developing versions are called branches.
            Branch is
            also a Git instruction for establishing a branch, which can copy a historical version and independently
            become
            another new branch version, while the Merge instruction is just the opposite, which is to merge two
            different
            branch versions into it. on a branch.<br><br>

            &emsp; &emsp;<br><br>
            &emsp; &emsp; Most developers develop on the trunk, but each version has different purposes and functions.
            If
            the version is only built on the one-stop trunk, it is still difficult for the team to track the software.
            development process.<br><br>
            &emsp; &emsp;Git provides a visual version line graph (commit graph) to present the tree structure formed by
            the
            connection between the trunk and each branch. However, as the project gets larger, the version line graph
            becomes more and more complex. The user can make good use of merge instructions to unify unnecessary
            branches
            and organize the version line diagram clearly.</h3></div>

            There are two types of tags used by Git: lightweight and annotated.<br><br>

            &emsp; &emsp; Lightweight tags: Like a branch that doesn't change, it's actually a reference to a specific
            commit object.

            <br>
            &emsp; &emsp; Annotated tags: It is actually a separate object stored in the repository, it has its own

            information, contains the label's name, email address and date, and the label description, the label itself
            also
            allows the use of GNU Privacy Guard ( GPG) to sign or verify.
            <br><br>

            &emsp; &emsp;To sum up, the lightweight tag is a reference, and the annotation tag is a separate object.
            Annotation tags are generally recommended to retain relevant details.

            the
            remote repository of other projects to his own remote repository, and then execute the Clone command to copy
            the
            entire project of his own remote repository. , including versions, to the local repository. <br><br></h3>

            <h3>&emsp; &emsp; Execute the push (Push) command, you can upload the relevant files of your
                current local
                repository to the remote repository, while the pull (Pull) command downloads the latest version of the
                remote
                repository to your local side. And merge the remote branch into the local branch. However, Pull does not
                download the content of each version of the complete project like the Clone command.<br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;Developers can execute Pull to obtain the code on the remote repository authorized by
                others,
                or
                push the code modified by themselves to the accessible third-party remote repository. Through the push
                (Push)
                and pull (Pull) two commands, developers can share the source code with each other. <br><br>

                &emsp; &emsp;Pull Request, on the other hand, is more proactive in requiring third-party developers to
                include
                their own programs, and integrate the code on the local repository into the other side's repository. For
                example, member A can request member B through a Pull Request to incorporate the code modified by member
                A
                into
                member B's development project.

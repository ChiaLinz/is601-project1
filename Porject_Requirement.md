# is601-project 2

The overall purpose of this assignment is to create a series of articles to help new programmers learn about testing, code quality, and object oriented programming. You should add these articles to your previous website from Project 1 and adjust it's navigation menu to accommodate this new content.. You need to work individually on this Project and you should use the website you created in the last Project as your base. The website that is turned in must look consistent.   You need to base all the articles on your own calculator program and use it to illustrate the concepts of the article, you cannot use my calculator, or generic explanations.  Each article should be well explained with images, code examples, and references to websites that you used to write the articles. 

1.  Create a glossary of OOP terms with definitions:, instantiation, object, class, namespace, constructor, fixture, type hint, type cast, unit test, static, instance method, instance property, static method, static property, encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, Overview of SOLID, and overview of Design Patterns

2. Create a tutorial that demonstrates AAA testing with Python and explain why testing is important.

3.  Explain how the calculator program demonstrates the principles of object oriented programming: Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. 

4. .  You can create an article on how the calculator demonstrates SOLID and identifies the use of design patterns such as the factory pattern.

Submission

1.  You need to have functional and/or unit tests to test your menu, web page, and the calculator including all of its sub functions.  You should have 100% test coverage and pass pylint.,

2.  Submit a link to your GitHub branch containing this project, you should have it on master even if it overwrites project one, since this project should add to project 1 and make it better.
